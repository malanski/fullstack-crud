About this project:

## Objectives

Web application (CRUD) to manage patient registers (Patient's name, birth date, email and address).

## Technologies

- Development of the front-end.
- Use React. https://reactjs.org
- Interface easy to use (UI/UX).
- Field validation (date, required fields, etc).
- Use Material UI https://material-ui.com 
- Frontend deploy at Vercel platform
- Backend deploy at Heroku platform
- Develop the back-end using NodeJS
<!-- - Cache the data in-browser. -->

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web application that will manage patient registers. The application will be a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that will allow users to manage patient information such as their name, birth date, email, and address.

## Front-end  
  
The front end of the application must be developed using React. The interface should be easy to use and follow good UI/UX principles. Field validation should be implemented to ensure that data entered by the user is valid (e.g., date fields should only accept valid dates, required fields should not be left blank, etc.).
  
The application is deployed to a cloud platform. The backend is developed using NodeJS also the data can be cached in-browser for faster access.## References  
  
## About the Code  
  
This project has clean and well-organized code, with an emphasis on correct naming conventions and adherence to patterns like PSRs, design patterns, and SOLID principles. Prioritizing code maintainability, error handling, and architecture, ensuring that the code is well thought out and structured before it is developed. I enjoy decoupling components such as additional layers, services, and repositories in order to produce modular and maintainable code. These characteristics make this project a dependable and stable option for our users.  
  
## TODO    
  
The application is deployed to a cloud platform. The backend is developed using NodeJS also the data can be cached in-browser for faster access.

## TODO + 1  
 
The backend can be switched to deployed using AWS Free Tier services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB or RDS. This will allow the application to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of AWS services.
