![logo ulissesmalanski-03 white copy](https://github.com/malanski/images/blob/main/logo-empuxo2.jpeg)

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a web application that will manage clients' registers. The application will be a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that will allow users to manage clients' information such as their name, birth date, email, and address.

## Objectives  
Web application (CRUD) to manage patient registers (Patient's name, birth date, email, and address).

## Project Basic Features

- Development of the front end.
- Use React. https://reactjs.org
- Interface easy to use (UI/UX).
- Use Material UI https://material-ui.com
- Field validation (date, required fields, etc).
- Frontend deployment at Vercel platform
- Backend database cloud deployments at Atlas MongoDB platform
- Backend server development using NodeJS and deployed at Render
<!-- - Cache the data in-browser. -->


## Front end    
The front end of the application must be developed using React. The interface should be easy to use and follow good UI/UX principles. Field validation should be implemented to ensure that data entered by the user is valid (e.g., date fields should only accept valid dates, required fields should not be left blank, etc.).
  
The application is deployed to a cloud platform. The backend is developed using NodeJS also the data can be cached in-browser for faster access.## References  

## Back end    
The DataBase: MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose and using Atlas Database Deployment. 
The server: developed using NodeJS and deployed at Render. 
     
## About the Code   
This project has clean and well-organized code, with an emphasis on correct naming conventions and adherence to patterns like PSRs, design patterns, and SOLID principles. Prioritizing code maintainability, error handling, and architecture, ensuring that the code is well thought out and structured before it is developed. I enjoy decoupling components such as additional layers, services, and repositories in order to produce modular and maintainable code. These characteristics make this project a dependable and stable option for our users.  
  
## TODO    
  
Make Data cached in-browser for faster access.

## TODO + 1  
 
The backend can be switched to deployed using AWS Free Tier services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB or RDS. This will allow the application to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of AWS services.
