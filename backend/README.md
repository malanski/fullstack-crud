## **API Heroku Cloud Deploy**
[https://my-register-backend.herokuapp.com](https://my-register-backend.herokuapp.com)

<hr>

## **Objectives**
To develop a Back end application with a `Client` model providing an interface to interact with the "Client" collection in the database. It allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the collection.  

## **Technologies**

This back end part of the project is developed with the following technologies: 
- NodeJs
  - Express Server web application library. 
  - MongoDb - Mongoose 
      In this project the model schema for the "Client" object uses Mongoose, which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB in Node.js.   
- JSON
- dotenv
  You must use your own username (DB_USER) and password (DB_PASS) and create a '.env' file in the backend root for MongoDb (Atlas) in order to run locally.
- Server deploy at Render or Heroku 
- MongoDB Cloud Atlas
