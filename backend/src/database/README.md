  `database/index.js`

This code sets up a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library in a Node.js application. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `const mongoose = require('mongoose');`  

This line imports the Mongoose library, which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It allows you to define data models and interact with MongoDB in a more structured and convenient way.  
  
2. `require("dotenv").config();`  
  
This line loads environment variables from a .env file into the application's environment. It allows you to store sensitive information like database credentials (in this case, the MongoDB Atlas username and password) outside of the codebase, enhancing security and making it easier to manage different environments.

3. `const userName = process.env.DB_USER` 
  This line retrieves the MongoDB Atlas username from the environment variables.

4. `const password = process.env.DB_PASS`  
  This line retrieves the MongoDB Atlas password from the environment variables.

5. ``const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@cluster0.eojloz1.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;``

This line constructs the connection URL for MongoDB Atlas using the retrieved username and password. The URL includes connection options like 'retryWrites' and 'w=majority'.

6. `mongoose.connect(url, {},  (error) => { ... }` 
  
 This line establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the provided connection URL. It uses `mongoose.connect()` method, which takes the URL, optional connection options (in this case, `{}` means no additional options), and a callback function that runs when the connection attempt is complete.

7. The callback function inside `mongoose.connect()` is used to handle any connection errors. If there's an error, it will be logged to the console with a message "Fail to connect to mongoose". Otherwise, if the connection is successful, it will log "You are connected to mongoose database".

8. `mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;` 
  
This line sets the Mongoose promise library to use the global promise implementation. This is not strictly required, but it ensures that Mongoose uses the same Promise implementation as the rest of your application.

9. `module.exports = mongoose;` 
  
 This line exports the Mongoose instance, making it available to other parts of the application so that they can interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose's functionality.
  
In summary, this code connects your Node.js application to a MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose. It uses environment variables to store sensitive information and establishes a secure connection to the database, enabling you to perform database operations in your application.
