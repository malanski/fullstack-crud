# About Controllers
   
  `controllers/clientsControllers.js`
  
This code sets up the backend API routes required for managing client data in the MongoDB database. These routes allow clients to be created, read, updated, and deleted, providing essential functionality for a client management system.

It defines a set of API routes using the Express framework to handle CRUD operations for a "Client" model in a MongoDB database. The code creates routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting client records.

## Create

`router.post('/client', async (req, res) => {...})` 
    
 This route handles the creation of a new client record. It checks if a client with the given email already exists and returns an error if so. If the client is unique, it creates a new client record and responds with a success message.

 ## Read

`router.get('/clients', async (req, res) => {...})` 
 
  This route fetches all client records from the database and returns them as a response. If there are no clients registered, it returns an error message.

`router.get('/client/:id', async (req, res) => {...})` 
  
 This route fetches a specific client record based on the provided client ID. If the client with the given ID is not found, it returns an error message.

## Update 
 
`router.patch('/client/:id', async (req, res) => {...})` 
 
This route updates a client record with the provided client ID. It first checks if the client exists, and if so, it updates the record with the new data and responds with a success message.


## Delete 
  
`router.delete('/client/:id', async (req, res) => {...})` 

 This route deletes a client record based on the provided client ID. If the client is not found, it returns an error message. If the client is successfully deleted, it responds with a success message.
