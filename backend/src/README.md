## About server.js code  
This code sets up a web server using Express, defines the routes for handling HTTP requests using the `clientsControllers` module, and starts the server so that it can respond to incoming requests. This allows the server to communicate with clients (such as front-end applications) and execute the logic defined in the controllers to handle the data and send appropriate responses.  

## 1. Importing Modules:
   - `const express = require('express');`: This is importing the `express` module, which is a web application library for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating servers and defining routes for handling HTTP requests.  
   - `const cors = require('cors');`: The `cors` module allows the app to set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing security policies, which is useful when you want to allow a server to be accessed by a client from a different source.  
  
## 2. Controllers:  
- `const clientsControllers = require('./controllers/clientsControllers');`:   
   In this line, we are importing a module called `clientsControllers` from a file called `clientsControllers.js`. 
   This is a common approach in Node.js applications, where controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and sending appropriate responses. 
  
## 3. Express application setup:
   - `const app = express();`:  
     Here we create the Express application called `app`. The application is the basis for creating a web server in Express.  
  
## 4. Use of middleware:  
   - `app.use(express.json(), cors());`:  
    Along these lines, we are using two middleware in the Express application. Middleware are functions that are executed during the lifecycle of an HTTP request.  
   - `express.json()` 
    is a middleware that parses the body of HTTP requests with JSON format. 
    - `cors()` 
     is a middleware that allows resource sharing between different sources. This middleware runs on every request the application receives.   
     
## 5. Route Configuration:  
   - `app.use('/', clientsControllers)`:   
      It Define the `'/'` route to use the `clientsControllers` module. This means that all requests to the server will be handled by the functions defined in `clientsControllers.js`. 
  
## 6. Initializing the server:  
- `app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8000,  () => { console.log('The server is running') });`:  
    This line starts the server. The `app.listen()` method causes the server to start listening for HTTP requests on the specified port (in this case, `process.env.PORT` or `8000`, if the `PORT` environment variable is not set). When the server is active and ready to receive requests, the message "The server is running" will be displayed on the console.
